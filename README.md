# 🚀 LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions 💻

> **A journey of a thousand bugs begins with a single `console.log()`...**

Welcome to my **LeetCode** repository, where I tackle algorithmic challenges one day at a time! 🧩 This is my "just-for-fun" project to improve my problem-solving skills, one commit at a time.

## 🌟 Why?
- **Challenge myself**: Algorithms can be tough, but they’re also rewarding!
- **Build consistency**: Coding every day builds habits that last.
- **Document progress**: Track my journey from rookie to pro! 😎

## 📚 What’s Inside?
You'll find:
- Solutions to various **LeetCode problems**.
- Clean and readable code (well... most of the time 😅).
- A mix of approaches: brute force, optimized solutions, and "creative-but-maybe-not-best" ideas.

## 🏆 Highlights
- **Languages Used:** Mostly **TypeScript**, but occasionally experimenting with other languages.
- **Synced with LeetHub**: Automating the grind, so I can focus on learning.
- **Fun Stats:** 
  - Total Problems Solved: _Still counting..._
  - Favorite Problem: _To be decided!_

## 🎯 Goals
1. Solve at least **one problem per day**.
2. Refactor messy solutions and make them elegant.
3. Share tips and insights along the way.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
Feel free to:
1. Browse my solutions for inspiration or reference.
2. Clone the repo to try problems on your own.
3. Share feedback or alternative solutions via pull requests or issues. Collaboration is always welcome! 🤝

## 📢 Disclaimer
- This repository is **not** about finding the perfect solution but about learning and growing. Feedback and improvements are welcome!
